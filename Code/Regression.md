| Regression Model     | Pros        | Cons  |
| :---------------------: |:--------------:| :--------------:|
| Linear Regression   | Works on any size of dataset, gives informations about relevance of features | The Linear Regression Assumptions |
| Polynomial Regression      | Works on any size of dataset, works very well on non linear problems      |   Need to choose the right polynomial degree for a good bias/variance tradeoff|
| SVR | Easily adaptable, works very well on non linear problems, not biased by outliers     |    Compulsory to apply feature scaling, not well known, more difficult to understand |
|Decision Tree Regression| Interpretability, no need for feature scaling, works on both linear / nonlinear problems|Poor results on too small datasets, overfitting can easily occur
|Random Forest Regression| Powerful and accurate, good performance on many problems, including non linear| No interpretability,overfitting can easily occur, need to choose the number of trees
